<p>
Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, popularly known a GITAM ,
was founded in 1980 by an inspired group of eminent intellectuals and industrialists of
Andhra Pradesh led by Dr. M. V.V. S. Murthi, former Member of Parliament and
popular philanthropist. The vision of MAHATMA, the Father of the Nation was to see
India as a socially and economically resurgent country and he looked upon education
as an important means to achieve this goal. Gandhijis view of education was not
narrow or sectarian. He envisaged universities as institutions of higher learning that
transcend all linguistic, racial and other barriers. GITAM is committed to imbibe his
values and abide by his philosophy. </p>
